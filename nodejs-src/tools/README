This folder contains collections of scripts that are run manually.
Each script has a comment block at the top of the file describing how to run it.

./app-command
These scripts put and delete the application commands needed to interact with the bot.
They are only needed if the commands get updated or changed.

./maintenance
These script are used for any number of one-off tasks. Debugging or migrating data or similar.
These are probably not needed at all but I prefer to keep them around.
