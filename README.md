# AnnounceCast Java

A simple Discord Podcasts announcement bot.  
Follows some Podcasts on your server and lets you know when new episodes drop.

## Using the Hosted Bot

It is mostly likely that just want to invite the bot to your Discord server and use it. You can
find [that documentation here](https://jimlind.github.io/AnnounceCast/).

## Hosting Your Own Bot

If you want to host your own version of the bot or use this code as a starting point for building your own bot that's
what this whole GitHub repository is about. But, again, you probably want to click the link above. Go ahead and browse
the code, checkout
my [notes on setting up a server to host a version of the bot](https://github.com/jimlind/AnnounceCast/tree/main/docs/hosted),
or the [historic NodeJS branch.](https://github.com/jimlind/AnnounceCast/tree/nodejs)

## Some Great Podcasts to Experiment With

If the bot isn't following any podcasts it is going to be very quiet. Follow some podcasts and wait for them to release
new episodes. You can use `/follow` and enter the name of the show or `/follow-rss` if you want to copy and paste the
URL of the RSS feed. Both will work as expected.
