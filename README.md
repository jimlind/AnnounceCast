## Using the Hosted Bot

It is likely that you want to figure out how to use my hosted bot on your Discord server. You can find [that documentation here](https://jimlind.github.io/AnnounceCast/). That documentation has an invitation link and a covers all the commands that the bot understands.

## Hosting Your Own Bot

If you want to host your own version of the bot or use this code as a starting point for building your own bot that's what this whole GitHub repository is about. But you probably want to click the link above. Go ahead and browse the code or checkout my chaotic [notes on setting up a server to host a version of the bot.](https://github.com/jimlind/AnnounceCast/tree/main/docs/hosted)

## Some Great Podcasts to Experiment With

If you aren't really sure what you should be doing with the bot you need to follow some podcasts and wait for them to release new episodes. You can use `/follow` and enter the name of the show or `/follow-rss` if you want to copy and paste the URL of the RSS feed. Both will work as expected.
