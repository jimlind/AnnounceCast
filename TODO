New Feature: Make channel optional for tagging and following

DONE:

How to store the data?
 - ALTER TABLE promoted_feed ADD COLUMN user_id TEXT;
Ensure that admin commands can only be used by Patreon Members
 - This is going to require special permissions to check discord roles. I don't want to do that.
 - I can probably get it directly from Patreon instead. Getting the data from their API.
 - Create a task that updates the local patreon membership regularly.

Tag Data Structure:

Cleanup
 - Move all the commands to new commands instead of trying to bundle them.
 - Document them in the help. Use the :parking: emoji.
 - Delete all the "Admin" classes that won't be needed.
